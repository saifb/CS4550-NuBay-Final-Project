# CS4550: Web Development

## Project Title: NUBAY

Repository Purpose: Frontend Client for users

Authors: Saif Billah, Andre Dahan, and Ronit Sharma

Technologies used: React, HTML, CSS, Javascript, Ebay API, Heroku

The problem that we want to solve is that there isn't an easy to use, Northeastern-only marketplace. We want to allow anyone with access to a husky email to buy and sell products and services. Our goal is to make our website a one-stop-shop for any Northeastern student looking to purchase a product or service.

If you would like to check out our website, here it is: http://nubay-frontend.herokuapp.com

Note: It will most likely take a bit of time to load initially because heroku needs to get it all fired up :)
